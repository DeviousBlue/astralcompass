Deck Visualizer for Spire

This is just a simple tool for me or others to use while playing the spire. 
Gives graph(s) of card deck contents for easy visual reference when making decisions about deck composition while you play. 

Unfortunately only manual entry of contents are possible beyond the static starting set of cards for each character as the 
game data is only ever stored locally and not made available to third parties by any means I'm aware of.
